Hi, my name is Parag Nair. Software Engineer with years of experience in Microsoft technologies. My interest lies in developing cutting edge web applications with interactivity, leveraging latest technologies. When I am not coding, I am with family and a day over summer weekend is spent playing cricket, probably the only sport I love. I was born in Mumbai, India and now live in the UK.
