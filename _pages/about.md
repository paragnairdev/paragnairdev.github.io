<p>I am a Software Engineer with years of experience in Microsoft technologies interested in developing cutting edge web application with interactivity, leveraging latest technologies. I have been hands-on most of my career and consider myself a Full-Stack developer.</p>

<p>I have been developing solutions using various technologies. ASP.Net, .Net Core, Node, Angular, Elasticsearch to name a few. Having said that, the concept of <strong>Microservices</strong> has made it irrelevant what programming language you choose.</p>

<p>With the advent of cloud services, I have taken a keen interest in the AWS ecosystem and have now think Cloud-First. If you have spoken to me about solving a problem in a decoupled manner, you will hear me use SQS as the go-to service.</p>
