  Hi, my name is Parag Nair. I am a Software Engineer with years of experience in Microsoft technologies. My interest lies in developing cutting edge web applications with interactivity, leveraging latest technologies. When I am not coding, I am with family and a day over summer weekend is spent playing cricket, probably the only sport I religiously follow. I was born in Mumbai, India and now live in the UK.

  <h2>Key Roles</h2>

  <p>
  Here are some of the companies I worked for, where I enjoyed working the most, as there was a lot to learn and I was fortunate enough to work with some smart people. It is not a coincidence that I have had the best managers at these companies as well.

      This was the first company I worked for, when I moved to London back in 2010. I was quite nervous to start as I did not know what to expect, but the wonderful people working in this company made me so comfortable and more importantly trusted my abilities. I started off with the enhancement of their lead generation platform and soon moved on to being a key member of planning and implementation of new technologies to make the system robust, secure and performance oriented. This was probably the firs time I had worked on a high throughput trading platform. The experience I got here was invaluable and has taught me a lot.

      <h3>Team Lead @ Iventa Software Services</h3>
      <small>2005 - 2009</small>

      <p>
      An Ecommerce CMS platform which once powered the ecommerce system for high-profile artists like Metallica & Kid Rock which was then acquired by Commerce Planet in 2007.
      </p>

      <p>
      There was a time when I was working for a top fortune 500 company with complete job security and came across an opportunity at Iventa. I realized I was not learning much where I am and took the leap of faith and joined Iventa. I think that was the best decision I ever made at that time. The company was a startup in India and my employee number was 00003. I was the 3rd Employee of the company. I started as a developer and got exposure to so much tech and experience, it was invaluable. I have to thank 2 people for that, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaheenr/" target="_blank">Shaheen Rampurawala</a> who gave me this opportunity and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjstafford/" target="_blank">Jameson Stafford</a>, who went out of his way to get me to work in Los Angeles. Those 4 years were definitely golden for me. I will be forever indebted to them.
