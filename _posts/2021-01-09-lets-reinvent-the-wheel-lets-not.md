Have you come across the statement "Let's reinvent the wheel"? Yes, we definitely know what it means.. bubt as a Developer, you want to reinvent it, don't you?

A word of advice, when your Developer brain says "We can build this", just take some time to assess if, what you want to build adds any value over what is already tried and tested.

Let me take you down my memory lane. There was a time when I was purely a Developer (still in my mind I am), and we had this roadmap meeting where the next feature we wanted in our system was Blogs. As soon as we understood the requirement, my brain already started coding it. I had database schema mapped up, the UML diagram started flashing, some nerves within that brain fired messages which particularly started with the statement "It will be great to have...". I was overexcited and just wanted to get my hands on building this module.

Then there was this voice which came from across the table - "Lets look at the documentation and pricing for some Community Blogs that are available in the market to plug into our system." It was Thomas, a new manager recruit whom I had hardly worked with. The developer within me heard it as "I do not trust our development team and hence we should get this work outsourced". All my enthusiasm came to a griding halt. I immedeately ran the `DROP DATABASE` command for the beautiful schema which I had built within my brain in a span of few minutes.

My next 30 mins were spent trying to convince the management that we have a strong & large development team with qualified engineers who can build this system. Everyone in the room listened to me patiently and acknowledged my enthusiasm and the trust in the development team.
