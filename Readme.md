# Post

Posts support 3 extra Front Matter variables
* `featured`: Defaulted to false. If set to true, this post will show up on the home page.
* `hidden`: Defaulted to false. If you set featured to true then you might want to set this to true, if you leave it as default, this post will show up in both Featured section as well as other posts section which might look like a duplication.
* `featured-image`: All posts in the featured section show the image for the post as Cover. So there might be posts where the center of the image (which shows up in Cover mode) might have content which would make it look odd without the rest. In that case you can create another image with only what you want to show up in featured section. Set this to that image path and the featured image will show up only in featured section.
